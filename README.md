# Build a Portfolio Site

Project 2 of Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree

### About 
This single webpage uses the css framework bootstrap to design the grid layout and make the images responsive for all device sizes.
The featured work section is clickable and opens a modal for a more detailed description of that work.

The featured work sections content is filler for now and will be changed when the other projects are completed.

### How to run
Clone or download this github repository then open the index.html file in your browser to see the portfolio.
